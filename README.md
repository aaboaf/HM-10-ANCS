# HM-10-ANCS
Code for interfacing with the HM-10 BLE module with ANCS and arduino

I've commented out my attempts to talk with the module, as I haven't quite figured out how to interpret notification information after sending the request. I don't know why they can't just add a newline to the end of the message. Feel free to commit changes if you figure out what I couldn't
